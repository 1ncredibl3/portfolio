    CyberChallenge.IT is an educational program 
    for young students between 16 and 23 years old. 
    It is the major Italian initiative to identify, attract, recruit, and 
    place the next generation of cybersecurity professionals.

    Thanks to my skills, I was chosen to be part of the team which
    represented The Polytechnic University of Bari in the nationals phase of the challenge
    against other universities in Italy.
